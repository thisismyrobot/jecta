Functional Specification - Jecta
================================

Introduction
------------

The idea of this document is to outline the basics of Jecta so that there is a
plan to follow instead of meandering and aimless development.

The points in the milestones are the goals needed to be achieved before that
milestone is considered complete. As the milestones are reached the git
repository will be tagged - 'M.1' etc.

General idea
------------

Jecta is a project (proJECTA) assistant. It is designed to allow the tagging of
file system paths/objects, urls and text so that they can be easily retrieved.

The above types are dropped onto a helper area which then prompts the user for a
tag for that data. New tags can be created, old tags selected (via autocomplete)
and multiple (space/comma-seperated) tags can be attached to a single dropped
item.

Seperate to the tagging process is the searching process. A user can enter one
or more space/comma-seperated tags (assisted by autocomplete) and an aggregate
of types matching that tag will be listed. Links will be clickable and any
dropped text will be summarised, clicking on a summary will bring up the full text.

Milestone 1
-----------
 * Basic windows for drop, tag and search that function correctly
 * Single tag tagging/search
 * Results listings are not clickable

Milestone 2
-----------
 * Autocomplete for tag creation/selection/search

Milestone 3
-----------
 * Multiple-tag entry for tagging and searching

Milestone 4
-----------
 * Results listings are clickable where it is a link - not for text

Milestone 5
-----------
 * Text is clickable in results listings - brings up default editor with contents

Milestone 6
-----------
 * When dropping a path, the path is traversed to tag all sub-files

Milestone 7
-----------
 * Search searches contents of dropped data, weights it and inserts it in aggregate
   with the tag-match results

Milestone 8
-----------
 * Database is exportable to xml

Milestone 9
-----------
 * Skinning of app for visual appeal

Release 1
---------
 * Windows compatability?
 * Deployment automation
